      "                \"Noticia\": \"(NEW YORK) — Junk, resort, destination, urban, and amenity fees are pseudonyms for the mandatory, often unexpected surcharges you might find tackled on your hotel bill. According to the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), these fees cost Americans nearly $3.4 billion annually and despite recent bipartisan efforts by the Biden administration to combat junk fees entirely, they still seem to pop up when it’s time to pay for your stay.\\n\\n“The consumer is the loser” when it comes to junk fees, Clint Henderson, managing editor at The Points Guy, told ABC News’ Good Morning America.\\n\\nThe value of what’s being delivered has fallen dramatically for consumers, who are now paying all-encompassing fees for erroneous line items such as Wi-Fi, phone calls, fax machines, towels, beach access, breakfast, parking, fitness centers and more — the list goes on, and “it’s getting hard to keep up,” Henderson said.\\n\\n“The consumer can only take so much of these [fees] before they break,” said Henderson, adding that “spending hundreds of dollars more on a seven-day holiday can make the cost of travel out of reach for some people.”\\n\\nDepending on the type of accommodation and length of stay, consumers can expect to pay an average of $38.82 more per night at hotels that charge resort fees, according to a 2024 analysis from NerdWallet.\\n\\nThe push to eliminate junk fees\\n\\nOverwhelming ‘fee fatigue’ among Americans has led to increased regulatory scrutiny at the federal and state levels. The House of Representatives passed in June the No Hidden FEES Act, which would create federal guidelines for being transparent about hidden costs at stays and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would pursue those who are in violation.\\n\\n“Americans are tired of being played for suckers,” said President Joe Biden during his February State of the Union address in which he announced his administration’s proposed Junk Fee Prevention Act aimed at eliminating hidden fees and encouraging customers to fight unfair charges.\\n\\nIn October, the FTC proposed a rule to prohibit hidden and bogus fees in all sectors of the U.S. economy, including hotels and short-term lodging.\\n\\nAt the state level, California’s SB 478 law, which went into effect July 1, requires businesses to advertise or list prices inclusive of all mandatory charges. At least 10 other states have followed suit by proposing or enacting junk fee statutes targeting increased fee transparency.\\n\\n“While price clarity helps, hotels still have a vested interest in keeping these fees…it’s pure profit for them,” said Henderson.\\n\\nCritics argue that resort fees allow a hotel to effectively increase room rates without changing their advertised prices nor paying extra taxes.\\n\\n“Whether hidden or not, [junk fees] contribute to these companies’ bottom lines and are still making their way into your bills,” said Henderson.\\n\\nProtect yourself from junk fees\\n\\nHenderson shared some tips to protect yourself from added junk fees when booking your next stay:\\n\\n1. Search for places that don’t charge resort fees\\n\\nThe best way to avoid junk fees is by not being charged them in the first place.\\n\\n“Knowledge is power for consumers and the more you know, the more you can make smart decisions with your money,” said Henderson, who suggests using sites like Kill Resort Fees to locate high-fee hotels ahead of time.\\n\\nBonus: Henderson also advises to plan for tips in your calculations to make sure you’re choosing a destination that fits your budget.\\n\\n“Even in foreign countries, Americans are often expected to offer something,” he said.\\n\\n2. Ask to remove resort fees\\n\\nSpeaking up can go a long way. When making your hotel reservation or when checking-in, Henderson recommends asking the hotel if they will simply remove the fee from your total.\\n\\n“Negotiating is an option, too,” he said.\\n\\n3. Call your local congressperson and complain about junk fees\\n\\n“The louder we are, the more political pressure there is on these companies to stop junk fees,” said Henderson, “we’re seeing some progress, but there is still a long way to go.”\\n\\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.

Kennedy Jr. cannot appear on that state’s ballot because he did not provide a legitimate address on his petition.\\n\\nJudge Christina Ryba wrote in her ruling that the address listed on Kennedy’s nominating petition “was not Kennedy's bona fide and legitimate residence, but merely a ‘sham’ address that he assumed for the purpose of maintaining his voter registration and furthering his own political aspirations” in New York.\\n\\nThe court found that Kennedy has a pattern of “borrowing addresses from friends and relatives” while actually living in California.\\n\\n“Using a friend's address for political and voting purposes, while barely stepping foot on the premises, does not equate to residency under the Election Law,” Ryba wrote. “To hold otherwise would establish a dangerous precedent and open the door to the fraud and political mischief that the Election Law residency rules were designed to prevent.”\\n\\nIn a statement, the Kennedy campaign condemned the ruling and vowed to appeal.\\n\\nThe campaign said the ruling came “in spite of the fact that Kennedy is registered to vote in New York,” pays taxes in New York and has various state licenses — including a driver’s license, law license “and his falconry license.”\\n\\n“The Democrats are showing contempt for democracy,” Kennedy said in a statement. “They aren’t confident they can win at the ballot box, so they are trying to stop voters from having a choice. We will appeal and we will win.”\\n\\nThe latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows that voters have started moving away from third party and independent candidates after Vice President Harris entered the race and has been slated to be the Democratic nominee. The poll showed Kennedy’s support is down to just 5%.\\n\\nThe Kennedy campaign has said it plans to appear on the ballot in all 50 states — a costly and difficult logistical undertaking that has rarely been accomplished by an independent presidential candidate. Besides the cost of gathering hundreds of thousands of signatures across the country, one of the main costs are the various legal challenges filed against and by the candidate.\\n\\nCampaign officials have said they expect challenges from both parties as the election nears, but Kennedy says the Democratic National Committee in particular has been working to keep him off ballots.\\n\\n“The DNC has become a party that uses lawfare in place of the democratic election process,” he said in a statement.\\n\\nDNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said in a statement following the New York ruling, that Kennedy is a “troubled, reckless, and dangerous man.”\\n\\n“He doesn’t think the rules apply to him and he refuses to consider the consequences of his actions,” he said.\\n\\nThis ruling could ultimately potentially affect Kennedy's ability to get on other state ballots, since Kennedy used this New York address in other petitions as well.\\n\\nCopyright 2024 NPR\",\n",

Initially, only refunds worth ₹ 7 lakh were processed, but this amount surged in the following year.\\n\\nNotably, the GSTO approved these refunds within three days of filing the applications. After Ms. Sharma was transferred to Ward 22 of the GST office in 2021, over 50 firms suspiciously applied for migration from Ward 6 to Ward 22, which was quickly approved.\\n\\nThis unusual activity raised suspicions, prompting the GST Vigilance Department to investigate the offices of these firms, ultimately uncovering the fraud, which implicated the GST office itself.\\n\\nGenerated invoices worth ₹ 718 crore\\n\\nThe investigation revealed that the fake companies had generated invoices worth ₹ 718 crore, with all transactions being fictitious. The GSTO issued refunds without properly verifying invoices or Input Tax Credit (ITC) claims.\\n\\nIn the first phase, over 40 firms appeared to be supplying goods, but by the second phase, no records of these transactions existed. The investigation also found that for 15 of the companies, mandatory Aadhar Card and physical verifications were not conducted during the GST registration process.\\n\\nOut of the 53 firms that migrated to Ward 22 after Ms. Babita’s transfer, 48 received GST refunds totaling ₹ 12.32 crore. The Non-Objection Certificates (NOCs) from property owners for these firms were suspiciously prepared between July 26 and July 27, 2021, just after Ms. Sharma’s transfer to Ward 22.\\n\\nMUST READ: Billionaire Richard Lugner Dies at 91, Two Months After Marrying Sixth Wife, 42\\n\\nHow did they operate?\\n\\nFurther investigations revealed that the GST refunds were deposited into the bank accounts of three lawyers, Rajat, Mukesh, and Narendra Saini, as well as their family members, through multiple accounts. The ACB identified 1,000 bank accounts linked to the fake firms, their family members, and employees.\\n\\nThe trio operated 23 firms using a single email ID and phone numbers, with five firms sharing the same PAN number and email ID to obtain different GST registration numbers. These 23 firms issued fake invoices worth ₹ 173 crore, with seven companies involved in the medical goods sector, showing transactions worth ₹ 30 crore in their invoices.\\n\\nAmong those arrested were a fake firm owner, Manoj Goyal, and two transporters, Surjeet Singh and Lalit Kumar. The ACB discovered that forged e-way bills and receipts for transporting goods were created to secure GST refunds, with the transporters being paid for providing these fake documents without actually delivering any services.\",\n",
